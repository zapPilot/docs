# 🛡️ Safety & Security Overview

At Zap Pilot, security is not an afterthought — it's our foundation. We minimize risk through
diversification, non-custodial design, and transparent infrastructure. That said, some risks still
exist, and users should understand them before using the platform.

## 🏃 1. Protected from Project-Side Rug Pulls

Zap Pilot is fully **non-custodial**:

- We only interact with your assets during vault execution
- You retain control of your wallet at all times
- Even if Zap Pilot shuts down, your funds remain safe in your own wallet

---

## 🏗️ 2. Third-Party Protocol Risk Exists

Zap Pilot allocates capital across various third-party yield farms.  
While diversification reduces exposure to any single risk, it cannot eliminate systemic risks
entirely.

**How we mitigate this:**

- Spread funds across multiple pools and chains
- Avoid protocols with extremely low TVL or poor audit history
- Continually monitor performance and adjust exposure

> 🧠 Security isn’t just about code — it's about trust, control, and clear communication.

Your funds are always yours.  
We just help them work smarter.
