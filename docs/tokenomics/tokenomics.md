‚öôÔ∏è Zap Pilot Tokenomics (v2 ‚Äì 2025) üéØ Overview Zap Pilot is an on-chain portfolio autopilot. For
busy DeFi users, Zap Pilot cuts portfolio rebalancing from 30 min to 30 sec ‚Äî moving your crypto
across chains into higher-yield pools with one click, while every token stays in your own wallet.  
The $ZAP token uses a buyback-based token economy: no staking, no passive rewards, no empty
emissions ‚Äî just value aligned with actual protocol usage.
