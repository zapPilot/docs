# V1 Exploit Compensation Plan

To fairly reimburse early adopters who personally covered losses from the V1 exploit, we have
established a Compensation Pool worth US$20,380. The allocation is proportional to the actual loss
each user incurred, and includes a modest interest adjustment to account for the opportunity cost
during this period.

## Compensation Method

compensation will be paid using **stablecoins and ETH generated from protocol fees and revenue**,
rather than $ZAP tokens. This approach:

- Preserves $ZAP token value by avoiding token dumps for compensation
- Uses sustainable protocol-generated revenue (stablecoins/ETH)
- Ensures fair compensation without negatively impacting token holders

## Impact on Token Buybacks

**Note**: This compensation method will temporarily slow down the $ZAP token buyback program, as a
portion of protocol revenue will be allocated to V1 exploit compensation instead of token buybacks.
Once compensation is complete, the full protocol revenue will resume supporting token buybacks.
