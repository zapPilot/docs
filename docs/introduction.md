# ✈️ Welcome to Zap Pilot

**Be Greedy. When Others Are Fearful.**

Zap Pilot is a **sentiment-driven rebalancing engine** that helps you allocate smarter, avoid
extremes, and grow your long-term BTC/ETH holdings with confidence.

## 🌪 The Problem: Emotional Investing

Most crypto investors fail because of **human emotion**:

- 😱 **Selling in Panic**: Fear drives you to sell at the bottom.
- 🤑 **Buying in Greed**: FOMO drives you to buy at the top.
- 📉 **Inaction**: You freeze when you should be rebalancing.

## 🎯 The Solution: Sentiment-Driven Rebalancing

Zap Pilot automates the discipline of successful investors. We monitor the **Fear & Greed Index**
24/7 and help you execute the right strategy for the current market regime.

> "Buy in fear. Defend in greed."

### How It Works

1.  **Monitor Sentiment**: We track market emotion using the Fear & Greed Index.
2.  **Smart Allocation**: We suggest the mathematically optimal allocation (Crypto vs. Stablecoins)
    for each regime.
3.  **Gradual Execution**: You execute the rebalancing directly from your wallet, spread over 5-10
    days to avoid bad timing.

## 🌍 The 5 Market Regimes

We divide the market into 5 distinct regimes. _Note: Our strategies are **bi-directional**—we react
differently depending on whether the market is heating up or cooling down._

| :---------------- | :----------- | :---------------------------- |
| **Extreme Fear**  | 🔴 FGI < 25  | **Maximum Accumulation**      |
| **Fear**          | 🟠 FGI 25-45 | **Recovery** OR **Unwind LP** |
| **Neutral**       | 🟡 FGI 46-54 | **Holiday Mode (Do Nothing)** |
| **Greed**         | 🟢 FGI 55-75 | **Lock Gains** OR **Hold**    |
