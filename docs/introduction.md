**Your DeFi, On Autopilot** ✈️

Zap Pilot lets anyone invest in DeFi with one click — no bridging, no swapping, no guessing. You
keep your funds in your own wallet, and we handle the messy stuff.

## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

Traditional DeFi investing is **complicated**:

- Multiple wallets across different chains
- Complex transaction sequences
- High gas fees and failed transactions
- Constant portfolio monitoring and rebalancing
- Technical knowledge barriers

## ✨ The Zap Pilot Solution

We transform complex DeFi operations into **simple intentions**:

```
"I want to invest $1,000 in a balanced crypto portfolio with medium risk"
```

That's it. Our engine handles:

- ✅ Cross-chain asset allocation
- ✅ Optimal routing and execution

## 💡 Why Intent-Based?

Traditional DeFi requires you to know **how** to do something. Intent-based DeFi lets you focus on
**what** you want to achieve.

**Traditional Way:**

1. Bridge assets to target chain
2. Swap to required tokens
3. Add liquidity to pools
4. Stake LP tokens
5. Monitor and rebalance
6. Claim and compound rewards
7. Repeat across multiple protocols...

**Zap Pilot Way:**

1. "I want medium-risk yield farming"
2. ✨ Done ✨

## 🎯 Our Mission

**Democratize access to sophisticated DeFi strategies** while maintaining the core principles of
decentralization, transparency, and user control.

We believe everyone should have access to the same advanced financial tools that institutions use,
without the complexity or custody risks.
