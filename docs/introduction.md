# What is Zap Pilot?

**We’re an on-chain portfolio autopilot** ✈️

## The Problem with Traditional DeFi Management

- **30+ minutes** to rebalance positions manually
- **Multiple interfaces** for bridges, swaps, and protocols
- **High gas fees** from multiple transactions
- **Constant monitoring** required for optimal yields
- **Technical barriers** that limit accessibility

## The Zap Pilot Solution

**Traditional approach:**

1. Check yields across protocols → 2. Unstake assets → 3. Bridge tokens →
2. Swap into new allocations → 5. Restake → 6. Repeat every week or month

**With Zap Pilot:**

We cut portfolio rebalancing from **30 minutes to 30 seconds**, moving your crypto across chains
into higher-yield pools — in one click — while every token stays in **your own wallet**.

## Why Choose Zap Pilot?

### 🔁 **Intent-Centric Rebalancing**

Tell us what you want — we handle the entire workflow. Sell winners, buy laggards, shift to
higher-yielding pools, all with a single click.

- Predefined rebalancing strategies
- Custom allocation supported (e.g., 70/20/10)
- Optional scheduled rebalancing

### 🔒 **Non-Custodial by Design**

**Your keys, your coins.** Zap Pilot doesn’t hold funds. Every rebalance is executed directly from
your Account Abstraction (AA) wallet.
