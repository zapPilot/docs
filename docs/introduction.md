# What is Zap Pilot?

**Your DeFi, On Autopilot** ✈️

We’re an on-chain portfolio autopilot.

For busy DeFi users, Zap Pilot cuts portfolio rebalancing from 30 min to 30 sec, moving your crypto
across chains into higher-yield pools with one click while every token stays in your own wallet.

## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

Traditional DeFi investing is **complicated**:

- Multiple wallets across different chains
- Complex transaction sequences
- High gas fees and failed transactions
- Constant portfolio monitoring and rebalancing
- Technical knowledge barriers

## ✨ The Zap Pilot Solution

We transform complex DeFi operations into **simple intentions**:

```
"I want to invest $1,000 in a balanced crypto portfolio with medium risk"
```

That's it. Our engine handles:

- ✅ Cross-chain asset allocation
- ✅ Optimal routing and execution
- ✅ Continuous rebalancing
- ✅ Risk management
- ✅ Yield optimization

## 🔐 Built on Trust

### Non-Custodial by Design

- **Your keys, your crypto** - funds never leave your wallet
- **Reduced platform risk** - As an intent-execution engine, Zap Pilot doesn't have its own smart
  contracts for you to deposit into. You interact directly with audited third-party protocols.
- **Full transparency** - all operations on-chain and auditable

### Security First

- Smart contracts audited by leading security firms
- Insurance coverage through DeFi protocols
- Battle-tested infrastructure
- Open source and community verified

## 🌐 True Cross-Chain DeFi

Unlike other platforms that require bridging or multiple transactions, Zap Pilot natively operates
across:

- **Leading Layer 2s** (Arbitrum, Base, Optimism)
- **Ethereum**
- **Solana** (coming soon)
- **with more chains being added**

## 💡 Why Intent-Based?

Traditional DeFi requires you to know **how** to do something. Intent-based DeFi lets you focus on
**what** you want to achieve.

**Traditional Way:**

1. Bridge assets to target chain
2. Swap to required tokens
3. Add liquidity to pools
4. Stake LP tokens
5. Monitor and rebalance
6. Claim and compound rewards
7. Repeat across multiple protocols...

**Zap Pilot Way:**

1. "I want medium-risk yield farming"
2. ✨ Done ✨

## 🎯 Our Mission

**Democratize access to sophisticated DeFi strategies** while maintaining the core principles of
decentralization, transparency, and user control.

We believe everyone should have access to the same advanced financial tools that institutions use,
without the complexity or custody risks.
