# What is Zap Pilot?

**Your DeFi, On Autopilot** ✈️

We’re an on-chain portfolio autopilot.

For busy DeFi users, Zap Pilot cuts portfolio rebalancing from 30 min to 30 sec, moving your crypto
across chains into higher-yield pools with one click while every token stays in your own wallet.

Why Zap Pilot?

🔁 Intent-Centric Rebalancing You tell us what you want — we do the rest. Sell winners, buy
laggards, shift yield — all in one click. Zap into predefined strategies or build your own.

🔒 Non-Custodial by Design We never touch your funds. All zaps are executed directly from your own
Account Abstraction (AA) wallet, giving you full control and ownership.

🌉 Cross-Chain by Default No more juggling bridges, swaps, or interfaces. Zap Pilot seamlessly
handles bridging, swapping, staking, and more — across chains and protocols.

📈 Curated Vaults, Indices, and Memes Choose a passive yield vault, a cross-chain index, or a meme
portfolio. Zap Pilot supports any investment intent that can be codified — and rebalanced with one
click.
