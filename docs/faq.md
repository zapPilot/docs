# Frequently Asked Questions

**Quick answers to common questions** ❓

Get instant answers to the most common questions about Zap Pilot, our strategies, security, and how
to get started.

## 🔰 Getting Started

### **Q: What is Zap Pilot?**

**A:** Zap Pilot is an intent-based DeFi execution engine that automates complex cryptocurrency
investing. Instead of manually managing multiple protocols across different blockchains, you simply
tell us your investment goals and we handle everything automatically.

### **Q: How is this different from holding crypto on an exchange?**

**A:** Unlike exchanges where your crypto sits idle, Zap Pilot puts your assets to work earning
yield through DeFi protocols while you maintain full control of your funds. Your crypto never leaves
your wallet.

### **Q: What's the minimum amount to get started?**

**A:** You can start with as little as $50 for Stablecoin Vaults. Other strategies require $100-200
minimum to ensure cost-effective execution.

### **Q: Do I need to understand DeFi to use Zap Pilot?**

**A:** Not at all! That's the whole point. You just need to know your investment goals and risk
tolerance. We handle all the technical complexity behind the scenes.

### **Q: Which strategy should I choose?**

**A:** Take our [risk assessment](./getting-started) to get a personalized recommendation.
Generally:

- **Conservative investors**: Stablecoin Vaults
- **Moderate risk**: Index Funds
- **High risk/crypto believers**: Bitcoin or Ethereum strategies
- **Advanced users**: Custom strategies

## 🔐 Security & Safety

### **Q: How safe are my funds?**

**A:** Security is our top priority. Our non-custodial model means you are always in control of your
funds. Zap Pilot is an intent-execution engine that prepares transactions for you to sign; we do not
have our own smart contracts that take custody of your assets. This means you interact directly with
the end DeFi protocols, significantly reducing platform-specific risk.

### **Q: What does "non-custodial" mean?**

**A:** It means you always control your private keys and funds. Unlike centralized platforms (like
Celsius or FTX), we never take custody of your assets. Your crypto stays in your wallet and
interacts directly with DeFi protocols.

### **Q: Are the smart contracts audited?**

**A:** Yes, all our smart contracts are audited by leading security firms including Trail of Bits
and ConsenSys Diligence. We also maintain a $500k bug bounty program for additional security.

### **Q: What if a DeFi protocol gets hacked?**

**A:** We have multiple layers of protection:

- Insurance coverage through Nexus Mutual and other providers
- Real-time monitoring with automatic exit procedures
- Diversification across multiple protocols to limit exposure
- Emergency pause mechanisms for rapid response

### **Q: Can Zap Pilot steal my funds?**

**A:** No. Our smart contracts are designed so we can only execute approved strategy operations. We
cannot withdraw funds to our own accounts or prevent you from exiting your positions.

### **Q: What happens if Zap Pilot shuts down?**

**A:** Your funds remain safe in the DeFi protocols. You can always withdraw directly from the
protocols even if our interface goes offline. All positions are in your name, not ours.

## 💰 Strategies & Returns

### **Q: What returns can I expect?**

**A:** Returns vary by strategy and market conditions:

- **Stablecoin Vaults**: 15-25% APY (low risk)
- **Index Funds**: 15-25% APY (medium risk)
- **Bitcoin/Ethereum**: 10-35% APY (medium-high risk)
- **Custom**: Variable based on your configuration

Past performance doesn't guarantee future results, and all investments carry risk.

### **Q: How do you generate these returns?**

**A:** Through sophisticated DeFi strategies:

- **Lending**: Earn interest by lending to borrowers
- **Liquidity provision**: Earn fees from DEX trading
- **Staking**: Earn network rewards from proof-of-stake
- **Yield farming**: Earn tokens from protocol incentives
- **Arbitrage**: Profit from price differences across protocols

### **Q: Are returns guaranteed?**

**A:** No, cryptocurrency investments always carry risk. Returns can be negative during market
downturns. We use professional risk management, but we cannot guarantee profits.

### **Q: How often are strategies rebalanced?**

**A:** Automatically based on market conditions:

- **Stablecoin**: Weekly or when opportunities arise
- **Index Funds**: Monthly or when allocations drift >5%
- **Bitcoin/Ethereum**: Bi-weekly or based on market conditions
- **Custom**: Based on your preferences

### **Q: Can I withdraw anytime?**

**A:** Yes, most strategies support same-day withdrawal. Some complex positions might take 24-48
hours to unwind optimally, but emergency exits are always available.

## 💸 Fees & Costs

### **Q: What fees do you charge?**

**A:** We use a transparent, performance-aligned fee structure:

- **Entry Fee**: 1% one-time on deposit.
- **No ongoing fees**: No management or performance fees.
- **No withdrawal fees**: Free withdrawals anytime.
- **Gas fees**: Optimized and shared across users.

### **Q: Why do you charge performance fees?**

**A:** Performance fees align our interests with yours - we only make money when you make money
above market rates. This incentivizes us to maximize your returns.

### **Q: Are there any hidden fees?**

**A:** Absolutely not. All fees are disclosed upfront and tracked in real-time. The only costs
beyond our fees are blockchain gas fees, which we optimize and display transparently.

### **Q: How do gas fees work?**

**A:** Gas fees are the cost of transactions on blockchains. We optimize these by:

- Batching multiple operations together
- Timing transactions during low-fee periods
- Using the most cost-effective chains
- Sharing costs across all users

### **Q: Can I see exactly what I'm paying?**

**A:** Yes, your dashboard shows real-time fee tracking including:

- Total fees paid to date
- Management vs performance fee breakdown
- Gas costs and optimizations
- Fee projections for the year

## 🔄 Operations & Management
