## 🚀 Getting Started

### What do I need to start using Zap Pilot?

To get started, you need:

- Any Web3 wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
- Minimum **$100** in ETH or Stablecoins (USDC/USDT) on Base, Arbitrum, or Optimism.
- 5 minutes for initial setup.

### What is the minimum investment?

We recommend starting with at least **$100**. This ensures that gas fees for rebalancing don't eat
into your returns.

### Which crypto wallets are supported?

We support all major Web3 wallets including:

- **Browser Extensions:** MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow, Brave Wallet
- **Mobile Wallets:** Any wallet that supports WalletConnect

## 📊 Strategy & Investment

### How does the "Sentiment Strategy" work?

We use the **Fear & Greed Index** to determine the optimal allocation between Crypto (BTC/ETH) and
Stablecoins.

- When the market is **fearful** (prices low), we allocate more to **Crypto**.
- When the market is **greedy** (prices high), we allocate more to **Stablecoins**.

### How often does it rebalance?

Rebalancing only happens when the market shifts **regimes** (e.g., from Fear to Neutral). This
typically happens every few weeks or months. We don't overtrade on daily noise.

### What returns can I expect?

Our goal is to **outperform a static buy-and-hold strategy** by avoiding large drawdowns (selling in
Greed) and buying more heavily at bottoms (buying in Fear). _Past performance is not indicative of
future results._

## 💰 Fees & Costs

### What are the fees?

We charge a simple **1% Entry Fee** when you first deposit into the strategy.

### How do gas fees work?

You pay standard network gas fees for transactions. However, Zap Pilot optimizes these by spreading
execution over time and using efficient routing.
