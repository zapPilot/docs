# Automated Rebalancing

**Keep your portfolio optimized 24/7** 🔄

Zap Pilot's intelligent rebalancing system continuously monitors and adjusts your portfolio to
maintain optimal allocation, capture profits, and manage risk - all without any action required from
you.

## 🎯 Rebalancing Fundamentals

### Why Rebalancing Matters

#### **Drift Prevention**

Over time, successful assets grow while others shrink, causing your portfolio to drift from its
target allocation:

**Example: Index Fund Without Rebalancing**

```
Initial Allocation:  BTC 30% | ETH 25% | Others 45%
After 6 Months:      BTC 45% | ETH 20% | Others 35%
Result: Over-concentrated in BTC, reduced diversification
```

**With Zap Pilot Rebalancing:**

```
Target Allocation:   BTC 30% | ETH 25% | Others 45%
After 6 Months:      BTC 30% | ETH 25% | Others 45%
Result: Maintains optimal diversification and risk profile
```

#### **Profit Crystallization**

Rebalancing systematically takes profits from winners and reinvests in underperformers:

- **Sell High**: Automatically reduce positions that have outperformed
- **Buy Low**: Increase positions in assets that have underperformed
- **Compound Growth**: Reinvest profits to accelerate portfolio growth
- **Risk Management**: Prevent over-concentration in any single asset

### Rebalancing Triggers

#### **Threshold-Based Rebalancing**

Rebalancing occurs when allocations drift beyond acceptable ranges:

| Strategy              | Deviation Threshold | Typical Frequency |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| 🏦 Stablecoin Vaults  | 10%                 | Weekly            |
| 📈 Index Funds        | 5%                  | Monthly           |
| ₿ Bitcoin Strategies  | 7%                  | Bi-weekly         |
| Ξ Ethereum Strategies | 7%                  | Bi-weekly         |
| ⚙️ Custom Strategies  | Configurable        | Variable          |

#### **Time-Based Rebalancing**

Regular rebalancing regardless of drift:

- **Monthly**: Standard for most strategies
- **Weekly**: For high-volatility strategies
- **Quarterly**: For stable, low-maintenance strategies
- **Dynamic**: Frequency adjusts based on market volatility

#### **Opportunity-Based Rebalancing**

Triggered by market conditions:

- **Yield Changes**: Move assets to higher-yielding protocols
- **Market Events**: Respond to significant price movements
- **New Opportunities**: Deploy to newly available protocols
- **Risk Events**: Reduce exposure during market stress

## 🧠 Intelligent Rebalancing Logic

### Advanced Algorithms

#### **Kelly Criterion Implementation**

Our system uses the Kelly Criterion to determine optimal position sizes:

```python
def calculate_optimal_allocation(assets, expected_returns, covariance_matrix, risk_tolerance):
    """
    Calculate optimal portfolio weights using Kelly Criterion
    """
    # Expected excess returns
    excess_returns = expected_returns - risk_free_rate

    # Kelly weights
    kelly_weights = np.linalg.inv(covariance_matrix) @ excess_returns

    # Apply risk tolerance scaling
    optimal_weights = kelly_weights * risk_tolerance

    # Normalize and apply constraints
    return normalize_with_constraints(optimal_weights)
```

#### **Mean Reversion vs Momentum**

The system detects market regimes and adjusts rebalancing accordingly:

**Mean Reversion Markets (Sideways)**:

- **Aggressive Rebalancing**: Profit from reversals
- **Shorter Intervals**: More frequent adjustments
- **Tighter Thresholds**: React to smaller moves

**Momentum Markets (Trending)**:

- **Delayed Rebalancing**: Let trends run
- **Wider Thresholds**: Avoid fighting strong moves
- **Momentum Overlay**: Slight bias toward trending assets

#### **Volatility Adjustment**

Rebalancing frequency adapts to market volatility:

```typescript
interface VolatilityRegime {
  low: { threshold: 15; frequency: 'monthly' };
  medium: { threshold: 25; frequency: 'bi-weekly' };
  high: { threshold: 40; frequency: 'weekly' };
  extreme: { threshold: 60; frequency: 'daily' };
}
```

### Risk-Aware Rebalancing

#### **Dynamic Risk Budgeting**

- **Risk Parity**: Equal risk contribution from each asset
- **Volatility Targeting**: Maintain consistent portfolio volatility
- **Tail Risk Management**: Reduce exposure during extreme events
- **Correlation Adjustment**: Account for changing asset correlations

#### **Drawdown Protection**

When portfolio experiences significant losses:

- **Reduce Risk**: Lower overall portfolio risk
- **Preserve Capital**: Prioritize capital preservation
- **Gradual Recovery**: Slowly increase risk as markets recover
- **Stop-Loss Integration**: Respect user-defined stop-loss levels

## 💰 Cost-Optimized Execution

### Gas Efficiency

#### **Batched Operations**

Instead of multiple individual transactions:

```
Traditional Approach:
- Sell Asset A: $25 gas
- Sell Asset B: $25 gas
- Buy Asset C: $25 gas
- Buy Asset D: $25 gas
Total: $100 gas

Zap Pilot Approach:
- Batch rebalance: $35 gas
Total: $35 gas (65% savings)
```

#### **Intelligent Timing**

- **Gas Price Monitoring**: Execute during low gas periods
- **Network Analysis**: Choose optimal chains for execution
- **MEV Protection**: Use private mempools to avoid sandwich attacks
- **Deadline Management**: Balance urgency with cost efficiency

### Transaction Optimization

#### **Route Optimization**

Find the most efficient path for each trade:

- **Direct Swaps**: When available with good liquidity
- **Multi-Hop Routes**: Through intermediate pairs when more efficient
- **Cross-Chain Arbitrage**: Execute on different chains if cheaper
- **Protocol Aggregation**: Use best prices across all DEXs

#### **Slippage Management**

- **Dynamic Slippage**: Adjust based on market conditions
- **Size Optimization**: Break large trades into smaller chunks
- **Time Distribution**: Execute over time to minimize impact
- **Liquidity Analysis**: Wait for better liquidity when beneficial

## 📊 Strategy-Specific Rebalancing

### Stablecoin Vaults

#### **Yield Optimization Focus**

```typescript
interface StablecoinRebalancing {
  primary_goal: 'yield_maximization';
  triggers: {
    yield_differential: '0.5%'; // Move if 0.5% APY difference
    protocol_risk_change: 'any'; // React to risk changes
    liquidity_threshold: '1M'; // Ensure sufficient liquidity
  };
  constraints: {
    max_slippage: '0.1%'; // Very tight slippage tolerance
    max_gas_cost: '0.01%'; // Gas costs under 0.01% of position
  };
}
```

#### **Protocol Migration**

- **Yield Monitoring**: Continuous rate comparison across protocols
- **Risk Assessment**: Consider protocol security scores
- **Execution Efficiency**: Migrate only when benefits exceed costs
- **Gradual Migration**: Move large positions over time

### Index Funds

#### **Market Cap Rebalancing**

```typescript
interface IndexRebalancing {
  primary_goal: 'maintain_market_weights';
  schedule: 'monthly';
  triggers: {
    market_cap_change: '5%'; // Rebalance if weights drift >5%
    new_listings: 'immediate'; // Add qualifying new tokens
    delistings: 'immediate'; // Remove disqualified tokens
  };
  optimization: {
    minimize_trades: true; // Reduce unnecessary trading
    tax_efficiency: true; // Consider tax implications
    momentum_overlay: 'moderate'; // Slight momentum bias
  };
}
```

#### **Addition/Removal Logic**

- **Inclusion Criteria**: Market cap, liquidity, quality thresholds
- **Exclusion Triggers**: Falls below minimum criteria
- **Transition Period**: Gradual addition/removal over weeks
- **Impact Management**: Minimize price impact on other holdings

### Bitcoin/Ethereum Strategies

#### **Multi-Component Rebalancing**

These strategies have multiple components requiring different rebalancing approaches:

**Bitcoin Strategy Components:**

```typescript
interface BitcoinRebalancing {
  native_btc: { target: 20; rebalance: 'monthly' };
  wrapped_btc: { target: 40; rebalance: 'weekly' };
  derivatives: { target: 30; rebalance: 'daily' };
  infrastructure: { target: 10; rebalance: 'bi-weekly' };
}
```

**Component-Specific Logic:**

- **Native BTC**: Long-term holding, minimal rebalancing
- **Wrapped BTC**: Active DeFi deployment, frequent optimization
- **Derivatives**: Dynamic hedging and arbitrage
- **Infrastructure**: Opportunistic participation

### Custom Strategies

#### **User-Defined Rules**

```typescript
interface CustomRebalancing {
  user_preferences: {
    frequency: 'weekly' | 'monthly' | 'quarterly';
    deviation_threshold: number; // 1-20%
    cost_tolerance: number; // Max cost as % of portfolio
    tax_optimization: boolean; // Consider tax implications
  };
  advanced_rules: {
    momentum_factor: number; // -1 to 1, contrarian to momentum
    volatility_scaling: boolean; // Adjust for volatility
    correlation_limits: number; // Max correlation between assets
    sector_constraints: object; // Sector allocation limits
  };
}
```
