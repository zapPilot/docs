# How Zap Pilot Works

Zap Pilot transforms complex DeFi operations into simple, one-click experiences through our
intent-based execution engine. Here's how the magic happens:

## 🧠 Intent-Based Execution

### What Are Intents?

Instead of specifying **how** to execute transactions, you simply tell us **what** you want to
achieve:

```
Intent: "Invest $500 in a conservative stablecoin strategy"

Traditional DeFi: 12+ transactions across 3 chains
Zap Pilot: 1 click, fully automated
```

### The Intent Lifecycle

```

## ⚡ The 3-Step Process

### 1. **Express Your Intent**

- Choose investment amount
- Select strategy type
- Set risk preferences
- Define time horizon

### 2. **AI-Powered Planning**

- Analyze current market conditions
- Identify optimal protocols and chains
- Calculate best execution paths
- Plan gas-efficient transactions

### 3. **Execution with Approval**

- Execute across multiple chains simultaneously
- Optimize for lowest fees and best rates
- Monitor in real-time
- Propose rebalancing as needed for your approval

## 🔗 Cross-Chain Intelligence

### Native Multi-Chain Support

Zap Pilot doesn't just bridge assets — we natively understand and operate on multiple chains,
including leading Layer 2s, Ethereum, and Solana.

### Intelligent Routing

Our routing engine considers:

- **Gas costs** across all chains
- **Liquidity depth** in different pools
- **Yield opportunities** on each network
- **Bridge security** and speed
- **Current network congestion**

## 🎯 Strategy Execution

### Automated Portfolio Management

Once your strategy is live, Zap Pilot continuously:

#### **Monitors Performance**

- Track yields across all positions
- Monitor risk metrics in real-time
- Watch for strategy drift

#### **Optimizes Allocation**

- Rebalance when targets drift >5%
- Move assets to higher-yield opportunities

#### **Manages Risk**

- Diversify across protocols automatically

### Smart Rebalancing

Our Kelly Criterion-based allocation system:

- Calculates optimal position sizes
- Accounts for correlation between assets
- Minimizes transaction costs
- Maximizes risk-adjusted returns

## 🛡️ Account Abstraction Integration

### Gasless Experience with Account Abstraction

Through ThirdWeb's smart wallet infrastructure:

- **Gas sponsorship** for qualifying transactions via paymaster
- **Simplified onboarding** with social wallet options
- **Batch operations** to reduce transaction count
- **Multi-chain support** with unified experience

### Enhanced Security

- **Multi-signature support** for institutional users
- **Social recovery** options
- **Spending limits** and controls
- **Session keys** for automated strategies

## 📊 Real-Time Intelligence

### Market Analysis

- **24/7 yield monitoring** across 100+ protocols
- **Risk assessment** of DeFi protocols
- **Liquidity analysis** for optimal execution

### Portfolio Analytics

- **Performance attribution** - know what's driving returns (coming soon)
- **Risk decomposition** - understand your exposure
- **Scenario analysis** - stress test your portfolio
- **Tax optimization** - minimize taxable events

## 🔄 Continuous Optimization

### Dynamic Strategy Adjustment

Your strategy evolves with market conditions:

#### **Market Regime Detection**

- Bull market: Increase risk exposure
- Bear market: Preserve capital
- Sideways: Focus on yield generation

#### **Protocol Health Monitoring**

- Track TVL changes
- Monitor governance risks
- Watch for exploit warnings
- Automatic risk-off when needed

## 🏗️ Infrastructure

### Built for Scale

- **Modular architecture** for rapid protocol integration
- **Event-driven system** for real-time responsiveness
- **Redundant execution** to prevent failed transactions
- **High availability** with 99.9% uptime SLA

### Integration Partners

- **20+ DEX aggregators** for best swap rates
- **50+ yield protocols** for diverse opportunities
- **10+ bridge providers** for reliable cross-chain
- **5+ insurance providers** for risk coverage
