# Intent Execution Engine

The heart of Zap Pilot is our intent execution engine — a sophisticated system that translates user
intentions into optimal DeFi operations across multiple blockchains.

## 🎯 Understanding Intents

### What Makes an Intent?

An intent is a high-level expression of what you want to achieve, not how to achieve it:

#### **Traditional DeFi Approach:**

```
1. Bridge USDC from Ethereum to Arbitrum
2. Swap 50% USDC to ETH on Uniswap V3
3. Add USDC/ETH liquidity to pool
4. Stake LP tokens in Convex
5. Claim rewards and compound
```

#### **Intent-Based Approach:**

```
"I want $1000 invested in ETH/stablecoin yield farming
with medium risk tolerance"
```

### Intent Components

Every intent contains:

- **Objective**: What you want to achieve
- **Constraints**: Risk limits, time preferences
- **Preferences**: Chain preferences, gas tolerance
- **Context**: Current portfolio, market conditions

## ⚙️ The Execution Pipeline

### 1. Intent Parsing & Validation (Example)

```typescript
interface UserIntent {
  objective: 'invest' | 'withdraw' | 'rebalance';
  amount: string;
  strategy: 'stablecoin' | 'index' | 'btc' | 'eth' | 'custom';
  riskTolerance: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  timeHorizon: 'short' | 'medium' | 'long';
  constraints: {
    maxSlippage: number;
    gasLimit: string;
    chainPreferences: string[];
  };
}
```

### 2. Strategy Resolution

Our AI engine analyzes your intent against:

- **Current market conditions**
- **Available yield opportunities**
- **Your existing portfolio**
- **Risk-return optimization**

### 3. Execution Planning

The planner creates an optimal execution sequence:

#### **Path Finding**

- Identify all possible execution routes
- Calculate costs and risks for each path
- Select optimal route considering:
  - Total gas costs
  - Price impact
  - Time to execution
  - Failure probability

#### **Transaction Sequencing**

- Break complex operations into atomic steps
- Plan for failure recovery at each step
- Optimize for parallel execution where possible

### 4. Cross-Chain Orchestration

Execute operations across multiple chains simultaneously:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Intent Received] --> B[Strategy Planning]
    B --> C{Multi-Chain?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Parallel Execution]
    C -->|No| E[Single Chain Execution]
    D --> F[Chain A Operations]
    D --> G[Chain B Operations]
    D --> H[Chain C Operations]
    F --> I[Sync & Verify]
    G --> I
    H --> I
    E --> I
    I --> J[Portfolio Update]
```

## 🧠 AI-Powered Optimization

### Market Intelligence

Our system continuously learns from:

- **Historical yield data** across all protocols
- **Gas price patterns** on different chains
- **Liquidity depth** changes over time
- **Protocol risk events** and responses

### Adaptive Strategies

Strategies evolve based on:

- **Market regime changes** (bull/bear/sideways)
- **Your behavior patterns** and preferences
- **Performance feedback** from past executions
- **New protocol opportunities**

## 🔄 Continuous Monitoring

### Real-Time Portfolio Tracking

Once executed, we monitor:

- **Position performance** across all protocols
- **Risk metric changes** (correlation, volatility)
- **Yield optimization** opportunities
- **Rebalancing trigger** conditions

### Proactive Management

Automatic actions include:

- **Reward claiming** and auto-compounding
- **Rebalancing** when allocations drift >5%
- **Risk-off** moves during market stress
- **Yield optimization** switches to better rates

### Alert System

Get notified about:

- **Significant gains/losses** in positions
- **New yield opportunities** matching your profile
- **Risk warnings** for protocols you're using
- **Rebalancing** operations completed

## 🛠️ Advanced Features

### Custom Intent Scripting

Power users can create custom intents (Example):

```javascript
// Example: Dollar-cost averaging intent
const dcaIntent = {
  objective: 'recurring_invest',
  amount: '500',
  frequency: 'weekly',
  strategy: 'index',
  duration: '12_months',
  conditions: {
    pauseIf: 'portfolio_loss > 20%',
    increaseIf: 'btc_price < 40000',
  },
};
```

### Batch Intent Processing

Submit multiple intents at once:

- **Portfolio rebalancing** across strategies
- **Multi-strategy allocation** for diversification
- **Scheduled operations** for DCA and rebalancing

### Intent Templates

Pre-built templates for common strategies:

- **Index Fund**: Market Cap weighted strategys, S&P-500 liked strategy.
- **Conservative Income**: Stablecoin yield focus
- **Aggressive Growth**: High-risk, high-reward strategies
- **Market Neutral**: Delta-neutral strategies
