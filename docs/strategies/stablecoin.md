# Stablecoin Vaults

**Stable returns without the volatility** üè¶

Perfect for conservative investors who want to earn significantly more than traditional savings
accounts while maintaining capital stability.

## üéØ Strategy Overview

### Investment Thesis

Generate steady, predictable yields from stablecoins (USDC, USDT, DAI) by intelligently allocating
across the safest, highest-yielding DeFi protocols.

### Key Features

- **Low Risk**: Minimal price volatility exposure
- **Steady Yields**: 15-25% APY vs 0.1% in banks
- **High Liquidity**: Withdraw anytime without penalties
- **Diversified**: Spread across multiple protocols and chains

## üí∞ How It Works

### Multi-Protocol Allocation

Your funds are intelligently distributed across:

#### **Lending Protocols (40-60%)**

- **Aave**: Industry-leading lending protocol
- **Compound**: Battle-tested money markets
- **Moonwell**: Optimized for multichain
- **Venus**: BSC's premier lending platform

#### **Liquidity Pools (20-30%)**

- **Curve**: Stablecoin-optimized DEX
- **Uniswap V3**: Concentrated liquidity positions
- **Balancer**: Weighted pools with trading fees

#### **Yield Optimization (20-30%)**

#### **Reserve Buffer (5-10%)**

### Smart Allocation Algorithm

Our algorithm dynamically adjusts allocations based on:

- **Yield rates** across all protocols
- **Risk scores** and protocol health
- **Liquidity depth** and withdrawal needs
- **Gas costs** for rebalancing

Yes, withdrawals are processed instantly for amounts up to your reserve allocation, and within 24
hours for larger amounts requiring rebalancing.
