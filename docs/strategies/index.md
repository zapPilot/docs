# 📊 Investment Strategies Overview

Zap Pilot helps users achieve stable, high-yield portfolios through intent-based execution,
mathematical allocation, and full user custody.

## 🎯 Our Strategic Philosophy

At the core of our approach are three key principles:

- **Mathematically Optimized Allocation**
- **Transparent User Control**
- **Adaptive Risk Management**

---

## ⚖️ 1. Allocation Strategy: Kelly Criterion

### What is the Kelly Criterion?

The Kelly Criterion is a sophisticated mathematical approach to portfolio allocation that balances
potential returns against risk. It helps us determine the optimal amount to invest in each
opportunity.

**Full Explanation:** [Kelly Criterion Detailed Guide](./kelly-criterion)

#### 📐 Simplified Formula:

```
allocation ∝ expected return / variance
```

#### ✅ Key Benefits:

- 📈 Prioritizes low-volatility, high-reward opportunities
- 🛡️ Minimizes risk of over-concentration
- 🔄 Quarterly recalculation to adapt to market changes

---

## 🔁 2. Rebalancing: User-Driven Optimization

### Why User-Driven?

Since Zap Pilot is non-custodial, we empower you to control your investments while providing expert
guidance.

#### Rebalancing Features:

funds.
