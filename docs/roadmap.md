## 🔧 Feature Backlog

### 1. 🧠 Farming Pool Optimizer with Eigenlayer

- **Idea**: Use Eigenlayer to protect users from malicious strategies.
- **Problem**: Users want a true “set and forget” experience — e.g., moving LPs between farming
  pools. But malicious pools could be proposed and voted on, rug-pulling users.
- **Solution**: Research how to integrate Eigenlayer to add a security layer for farming pool
  strategies.

### 2. 🗳 Decentralized Fund Manager

- **Goal**: Turn dLP holders into active portfolio governors.

#### ✅ Deliverables:

- Allow users with locked dLP to:
  - Vote on allocation decisions
  - Propose additions/removals to the strategy vault

#### 🎯 KPI Goals:

- At least **20%** of dLP voting power has participated
- At least **1 pool added** and **1 pool removed**

#### 📊 Progress Tracking:

- Use **Dune Analytics** to track:
  - Voting participation rates
  - Changes to portfolio pools

### 3. 📈 Factor-Driven Allocation Adjustment

- **Idea**: Refine allocation logic using financial metrics.
- **Planned Factors**:
  - P/E and P/B percentile ranks
  - SDR Sharpe Ratio
  - Fama-French 5-Factor Model

---

### 4. 🧮 Portfolio Subgraph

- **Goal**: Index on-chain portfolio analytics using The Graph
- **Metrics to Index**:
  - P/E Ratio
  - SDR Sharpe Ratio
- **Outcome**: Standardize data access and monetize via query fees

---

### 5. 💰 Monetized Portfolio Visualization

- **Functionality**:
  - Users input wallet address
  - Calculate portfolio APR and monthly yield
  - Recommend superior pools
- **Business Model**: Fee-based premium analytics

---

### 6. 📱 Mobile App (CeFi-to-DeFi Onboarding)

- **Vision**: Offer a crypto-native mobile app with CeFi onramps
- **Features**:
  - Fiat onramp/offramp integration
  - Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) interface
