# 🛡️ Risk Management

Risk management is key to achieving stable wealth growth.

As a service called Zap Pilot, we prioritize minimizing risk. To mitigate avoidable risks, we've
implemented diversification strategies at both the asset and farming pool levels. However, there are
still certain risks that you should be aware of before proceeding.

🛡️ Free from the asset depreciation risk(Stablecoin Vault ONLY)

Stablecoin Vault is our flagship product. It's just like an online checking account where you can
deposit and withdraw anytime from your portfolio. Your investment in stablecoins is shielded from
significant price fluctuations.

🛡️ Free from project-side rug pull

Zap Pilot is a non-custodial service that interacts with your assets only during diversification
activities. Afterward, we do not control your wallet. If our service ceases to exist, your assets
remain unaffected.

⚠️ Third-party protocol risk exists, and we diversified to reduce the potential impact

Although the goal is to achieve a consistent, straight-line return, the returns are generated by
investing in a number of third party yield farming pools, each of which carries certain default
risk. While diversification reduces the risk associated with any single asset, it cannot be
completely eliminated.
