# Account Abstraction Wallet Tutorial

Account Abstraction (AA) wallets represent the next generation of crypto wallet technology, making
DeFi more accessible and user-friendly. This guide walks you through setting up and using your AA
wallet with Zap Pilot.

## What is Account Abstraction?

## AA Wallet Features

### Gasless Transactions

#### **How It Works**

Instead of paying gas with ETH:

```
Traditional: Your ETH â†’ Gas Fee â†’ Transaction
AA Wallet: Your USDC â†’ Sponsored â†’ Transaction
```

#### **Supported Fee Tokens**

- **USDC** (recommended)
- **USDT**
- **DAI**
- **ETH** (if you prefer)

#### **Fee Sponsorship**

For qualifying transactions:

- **New users**: First 3 transactions sponsored
- **Small amounts**: Transactions under $100
- **Strategy deposits**: Initial vault entries

### Batch Operations

#### **Single Transaction, Multiple Actions**

Traditional DeFi investment:

```
1. Approve USDC
2. Swap to target tokens
3. Add liquidity
4. Stake LP tokens
Total: 4 transactions, 4 gas fees
```

With AA wallet:

```
1. Batch: [approve, swap, add_liquidity, stake]
Total: 1 transaction, 1 gas fee
```

#### **Zap Pilot Integration**

When you "Zap In" to a strategy:

- Approval, swaps, deposits bundled
- Cross-chain operations coordinated
- Optimal gas usage across all steps

### Session Keys

#### **Automated Strategy Management**

Set up session keys for:

- **Automatic rebalancing** within set parameters
- **Yield harvesting** and compounding
- **Risk management** actions
- **Emergency exits** based on conditions

#### **Security Controls**

Session keys include:

- **Spending limits**: Maximum amount per transaction
- **Time limits**: Keys expire automatically
- **Action restrictions**: Only specific functions allowed
- **Revocation**: Cancel permissions anytime

## Wallet Security

### Multi-Signature Support

#### **Team Management**

- **2-of-3 signatures** for team accounts
- **Role-based permissions** for different functions
- **Spending thresholds** requiring multiple approvals

#### **Personal Security**

- **Guardian setup**: Trusted contacts for recovery
- **Device authorization**: Limit access to known devices
- **Transaction delays**: Time locks for large amounts

### Social Recovery

#### **No More Lost Seed Phrases**

Traditional recovery:

- Lose seed phrase = lose everything
- Complex backup requirements
- Single point of failure

AA wallet recovery:

- **Guardian network**: Friends/family can help recover
- **Social verification**: Multiple confirmation methods
- **Gradual access**: Recover step by step

#### **Recovery Process**

1. **Initiate Recovery**
   - Access "Recover Wallet" from any device
   - Verify identity through social provider

2. **Guardian Confirmation**
   - Pre-selected guardians receive recovery request
   - Majority approval required to proceed

3. **New Device Setup**
   - Install wallet on new device

```
IF portfolio_drift > 5% AND gas_cost < rebalancing_benefit
THEN execute_rebalancing()
```

#### **Yield Optimization**

```
IF new_yield_opportunity > current_yield + 2%
THEN propose_migration()
```

```
IF protocol_risk_score < threshold
