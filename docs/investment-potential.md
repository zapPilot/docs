# Investment Potential

Zap Pilot is a non-custodial DeFi autopilot that helps users build stable, high-yield portfolios
across chains in just a few clicks. Powered by AA Wallet and risk-aware allocation logic, we address
key pain points in crypto investing.

---

## 🚩 Problem We Solve

### ❌ DeFi is too complex

From bridging to staking, DeFi requires users to manage assets manually across protocols and chains
— it’s inaccessible to most investors.

### ❌ Smart allocation is hard

High yields exist, but users don’t know how to evaluate risks or optimize across pools. Most
portfolios are under-diversified and poorly rebalanced.

### ❌ Trust is scarce in DeFi

Traditional yield aggregators require custody, exposing users to rug pulls. Trustless tools with
good UX are rare.

---

## ✨ Zap Pilot's Unique Edge

### ✅ High Yields, Simplified

- Curated strategies with dynamic yield monitoring
- Cross-chain diversification into top-performing audited pools
- APYs above 15% made stable and sustainable

### ✅ Full Non-Custodial Control

- Users keep full control via AA Wallet (no tokens, no lock-ups)
- Supports social login, cold wallets, and will add 2FA & tx preview in 2025

### ✅ Diversified Risk Management

- Eliminates single-point-of-failure via token & pool-level diversification
- Actively removes low-TVL or unaudited pools
- Composability with on-chain DeFi maintained

---

## 📈 Scalability Potential

- **Tech side**: As usage grows, cross-chain infra + automation makes the service cheaper to operate
  per user
- **Finance side**: Like a BBB-rated bond aggregator, we maintain higher APYs than traditional
  “safe” DeFi tools
- **Regulatory side**: As global rules mature, we’re ready to expand toward regulated markets

---

## 🎯 Target Users

### 1. DeFi Power Users

- Juggle assets across GMX, Lido, Pendle, etc.
- Want a 1-click solution with full asset control

### 2. Stablecoin Yield Farmers

- Seek low-volatility, capital-preserving growth
- Need auto-diversified, high-yield stablecoin strategies

### ✅ Long-Term

- Future moat: regulatory compliance + user trust
- Brand strength will matter more than codebase
