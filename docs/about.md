## 👥 Meet the Team

### 🧠 David Chang — Founder

- **Current Role**: Data Engineer @ Dcard
- **Crypto Belief**: Nearly all assets are in crypto
- **Why Zap Pilot?**  
  David went all-in on crypto in 2022, managing his own yield farming strategies with full risk
  exposure.  
  Rebalancing his portfolio used to take 4+ hours — so he started building automation tools.  
  That project became Zap Pilot.

## 🔥 Why We Built Zap Pilot

David is our super-user founder. He lives by the strategy Zap Pilot automates — a diversified crypto
farming system designed to reduce risk and enhance yield. His life depends on it, and that gives him
a unique lens few builders have.

Adrian brings the operational excellence and battle-tested startup leadership needed to take that
vision to scale. After personally experiencing both the highs and lows of early crypto investing,
he's determined to help make DeFi safer and more sustainable for the next generation of users.

Together, they believe the path to adoption lies in **DeFi that works like TradFi — but better.**
