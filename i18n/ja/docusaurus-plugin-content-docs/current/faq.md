## 🔒 Security & Safety

### Is my money safe with Zap Pilot?

Yes, Zap Pilot is designed for maximum security:

- **Non-custodial:** Your funds never leave your wallet
- **No custody risk:** We can't access or freeze your funds
- **Your keys, your coins:** You maintain full ownership
- **Transparent:** All transactions are on-chain and verifiable

### What happens if Zap Pilot shuts down?

Your funds remain completely safe because:

- **Funds stay in your wallet:** We never hold your assets
- **Direct protocol access:** You can interact with DeFi protocols directly
- **No lock-in period:** Withdraw anytime without permission
- **Full transparency:** All contract addresses are public

### How is Zap Pilot different from other DeFi platforms?

| Feature          | Zap Pilot           | Traditional Platforms    |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Custody**      | ✅ Non-custodial    | ⚠️ Often custodial       |
| **Access**       | ✅ Withdraw anytime | ❌ Lock-up periods       |
| **Transparency** | ✅ Full on-chain    | ⚠️ Limited visibility    |
| **Risk**         | ✅ No platform risk | ❌ Platform custody risk |

### What if a protocol in my strategy gets hacked?

We minimize this risk through:

- **Diversification:** Funds spread across multiple protocols
- **Curation:** Only audited, established protocols
- **Monitoring:** Continuous security assessment
- **Risk limits:** No overexposure to any single protocol

If an incident occurs, you're only exposed to your allocation in that specific protocol, not your
entire investment.

## 💰 Fees & Costs

### What fees do I pay?

Zap Pilot has a simple, transparent fee structure:

- **Entry Fee:** 1% one-time when you deposit
- **Management Fee:** 0% (no ongoing fees)
- **Performance Fee:** 0% (we don't take a cut of profits)
- **Withdrawal Fee:** 0% (free to exit anytime)

### Are there any hidden costs?

No hidden fees from Zap Pilot. You'll also pay:

- **Gas fees:** Standard blockchain transaction costs
- **Protocol fees:** Native fees from DeFi protocols (typically 0.1-0.3%)

We optimize gas costs through batching and timing to minimize your expenses.

### How do gas fees work?

- **Shared costs:** We batch operations to reduce gas fees by 60-80%
- **Optimal timing:** Execute during low gas periods
- **Cross-chain optimization:** Use cheapest suitable networks
- **Transparent tracking:** See exactly what you've paid in gas

### When do I pay the 1% entry fee?

- **One-time payment:** Only when you first deposit into a strategy
- **No recurring fees:** Never pay again as long as funds remain invested
- **Example:** $10,000 investment = $100 entry fee, then $0 forever
