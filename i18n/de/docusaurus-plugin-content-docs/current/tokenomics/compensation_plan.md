# [TODO: TRANSLATE] V1 Exploit Compensation Plan

[TODO: TRANSLATE] To fairly reimburse early adopters who personally covered losses from the V1
exploit, we have established a Compensation Pool worth US$20,380. The allocation is proportional to
the actual loss each user incurred, and includes a modest interest adjustment to account for the
opportunity cost during this period.

## [TODO: TRANSLATE] Compensation Method

[TODO: TRANSLATE] compensation will be paid using **stablecoins and ETH generated from protocol fees
and revenue**, rather than $ZAP tokens. This approach:

- [TODO: TRANSLATE] Preserves $ZAP token value by avoiding token dumps for compensation
- [TODO: TRANSLATE] Uses sustainable protocol-generated revenue (stablecoins/ETH)
- [TODO: TRANSLATE] Ensures fair compensation without negatively impacting token holders

## [TODO: TRANSLATE] Impact on Token Buybacks

**[TODO: TRANSLATE] Note**: [TODO: TRANSLATE] This compensation method will temporarily slow down
the $ZAP token buyback program, as a portion of protocol revenue will be allocated to V1 exploit
compensation instead of token buybacks. Once compensation is complete, the full protocol revenue
will resume supporting token buybacks.
